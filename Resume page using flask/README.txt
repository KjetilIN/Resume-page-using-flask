# About 
So this is my first published github project.
My main probelem turned out to be CSS styling. It was a difficult thing to deal with.
The goal was to create an website that runs with flask. This page has currenltly only one page,
however I ecpect to update the project after a while.

# Tools

- Python, Flask module
- HTML via Visual Studio Code
- Adobe XD (Design)
- Affinity Photo


# Planned updates

- Java script animation
- Drop down menu of XX
- Footer upgrade
- Flask features?
- More pages?

# Current problems 
- White space under and over Footer
- the websites width is too long

You are allowed to use my design, however I would recommend creating it yourself. 
I made this page to learn about Flask, recommed to do so!
